Perfect ✅ — you’re asking for a 10-minute investor pitch for your AI Multi-Sport Coach startup.
Below is a complete spoken pitch script + slide outline.

It’s designed for seed-stage or pre-Series A investors — with a strong story, market logic, and clear funding ask.
Let’s call the startup “AthletiQ” (you can replace the name later).

🎤 10-Minute Investor Pitch: “AthletiQ – The AI Coach for Every Athlete”
🕒 Slide 1 — Opening / Problem (1 min)

Pitch:

Every athlete — whether they play football, basketball, tennis, or just hit the gym — dreams of having a personal coach who understands their sport, body, and goals.

The problem? Real coaches are expensive, inconsistent, and limited to one sport.

Current fitness apps only track steps or workouts. They don’t teach, analyze, or adapt.

There’s no single intelligent system that can act as your all-in-one sports coach, nutritionist, and performance analyst — across any sport.

⚙️ Slide 2 — Solution (1 min)

Pitch:

Meet AthletiQ — your personal AI sports coach.

You pick your sport — basketball, football, soccer, tennis, boxing, running — and AthletiQ builds a full, adaptive plan that includes:

Training sessions tailored to your sport and level

Nutrition and recovery schedules

Integration with Apple Health, Samsung Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, and Garmin

Our AI learns from your performance, heart rate, sleep, and progress — then adjusts your plan automatically.
It’s like having a professional coach, sports scientist, and dietitian — in your pocket.

📊 Slide 3 — Market Opportunity (1 min)

Pitch:

The global sports participation market exceeds 400 million active athletes.

Our total addressable market — people who train regularly and use digital tools — is about 300–400 million users.

Our serviceable available market — smartphone users interested in AI-driven performance — is roughly 100 million.

Our obtainable market in 3 years? 200 000 – 500 000 users.

Even with 50 000 paying users at €20 per month, we reach €12 million ARR — a scalable SaaS opportunity in a growing $20 billion sports-tech industry.

🧭 Slide 4 — Competitive Landscape (1 min)

Pitch:

The fitness-tech space is crowded — but fragmented.

Freeletics and Aaptiv focus on fitness workouts.

Volt and HomeCourt train you for one sport.

Fitbit and Garmin track data but don’t coach.

AthletiQ unifies it all: multi-sport coaching + nutrition + full data integration + adaptive AI.

Think ChatGPT meets Fitbit — a single system that actually guides your athletic development.

💰 Slide 5 — Business Model (1 min)

Pitch:

We keep it simple: one free tier, one premium plan.

Free (ad-supported): All sports access, limited AI personalization, ads generate ~€1 per user/month.

Premium (€20/month): Ad-free, full AI personalization, adaptive nutrition, analytics, and unlimited plans.

With an expected 5 % conversion from free → paid, and 500 000 free users, we reach 25 000 paying users, or about €6 million ARR.

🧠 Slide 6 — Technology (1 min)

Pitch:

AthletiQ uses the latest in generative AI, computer vision, and sports science modeling.

Our AI stack:

LLMs to generate and adapt personalized plans in real time

Machine learning models analyzing wearable data

(Future feature) Motion-capture via smartphone camera for form feedback

The AI also assists in app development — helping us generate drills, design plans, and personalize content at scale.

🏗️ Slide 7 — Development & Costs (1 min)

Pitch:

To build AthletiQ, we’ll use a hybrid tech team — human developers + AI-assisted code generation to keep burn rates low.

Initial build: €250 000 for app + backend + integrations.
AI infrastructure & compute: €10 000/month for model inference & fine-tuning.
Team: 4 core members — AI engineer, mobile developer, nutrition/sports science lead, and growth lead.

Total 18-month runway target: €500 000 – €700 000.

🚀 Slide 8 — Go-to-Market Plan (1 min)

Pitch:

We’ll target two primary segments:

Amateur & semi-pro athletes (ages 16–35).

Recreational multi-sport users who already use Fitbit or Apple Health.

Phase 1 – Launch on iOS + Android (English, then Spanish, German).
Phase 2 – Partner with sports academies, gyms, and influencers for visibility.
Phase 3 – Integrate with wearable OEMs for co-branding.

💹 Slide 9 — Financial Projections (1 min)
Year	Users (Free / Paid)	ARR	Key Milestone
Year 1	100 000 / 3 000	€720 000	Launch & traction
Year 2	300 000 / 10 000	€2.4 M	Multi-sport expansion
Year 3	1 000 000 / 50 000	€12 M	Global scale + profitability

Add ad revenue and B2B licensing (gyms, schools), and ARR could exceed €15 million.

💵 Slide 10 — Funding Ask (1 min)

Pitch:

We’re seeking €750 000 in seed funding to build and launch AthletiQ across Europe and North America.

Funds will go to:

40 % product & AI infrastructure

30 % team & talent

20 % marketing & partnerships

10 % legal, data compliance, & operations

In return, investors join a company redefining how athletes train, eat, and improve — powered by AI.

🌎 Slide 11 — Vision (Final 1 min)

Pitch:

We believe every athlete deserves a coach — not just the pros.

With AthletiQ, anyone can get expert-level guidance, personalized to their sport, their body, and their goals.

Our vision:

To make elite-level training accessible to everyone.

To create a world where AI helps every person move, perform, and live better.

Join us in shaping the future of athletic performance.

Thank you.
